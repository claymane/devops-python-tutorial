## This specific structure is very common in enterprise CS work.
## Create a project scaffold (software engineering best practices as code)

Creating a cloud based development is advantageous. Cloud based tech stack

### Colab Notebook

This is an example of how to use [colab](https://github.com/claymane/devops-python-tutorial/blob/main/devops_python_tutorial.ipynb)

### Github Codespaces

Build out a python project scaffold:

* Makefile -- file for building the application
* requirements.txt -- requirements for the application
* venv -- virtual environment for reliably including dependencies

`git add *`
`git commit -m 'optional message`
`git push`

* test_library.py
* python_library
* Dockerfile
* command-line-tool
* microservice

1. Create a virtualenv: `virtualenv ~/.venv`
2. Edit my `.bashrc` to automatically load the virtual environment by including `source ~/.venv/bin/activate` at the tail.
